my final project for ID tech
# Project Name
Wolf vs Dog classifier
An AI that can tell if an animal is either a dog or wolf. The ideal user is a sheapard to help recogize threats to their livestock.

## The Algorithm

I used an Image trainer that could tell a picture of a dog or a wolf. It could help shepards find potential predatores and avoid accidently detecting their sheperd dogs.The two classes that I trained are the Dog class full of dog photos and the Wolf class full of wolf photos.I chose this product because people should not just lose thing because your unlucky. To me security is very important and I hope this project can help improve it.

## Running this project

1. Download dataset from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishvutukuri/dogs-vs-wolves
2. transfer dataset on vs code or google colab
3. get code from the git reposity here: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KlzAJNyDy-Ng8-Ghw21XKXYwY1aUReTq>
3. unzip the data file and add it to the code
4. when namingfile make it easy and uncomplicated
5. run the code to train the model. 
6. Once the model is trained, input your test image and it will give you a result if it is a dog or wolf.
